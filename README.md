# Static Comp Challenge #1

I enjoyed this challenge because it was a nice introduction to messing around with CSS. Although it wasn't too easy,
it was easy enough for me to get comfortable with it. It was rewarding to understand and utilize flexbox. My greatest feat
was getting my two media queries to look somewhat decent.
